## Lagrange's Theorem
All positive integers can be represented as $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$.

## Zeckendorf's Theorem
Every positive integer is uniquely represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers such that no two numbers are consecutive or equal Fibonacci numbers.

## Pythagorean Triples
Euclid's formula can be used to find $(n^2-m^2, 2nm, n^2+m^2)$ for $n\perp m$.

## Wilson's Theorem
$(p-1)!\equiv -1 \pmod p$ for prime $p$.
