1. sum from x=1...n of x^k has a closed formula that is a polynomial of deg. k+1.
    - sum ^^ of x is n(n + 1)/2
    - sum ^^ of x^2 is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
    - sum ^^ of x^3 is [n(n+1)/2]^2

2. Arithmetic Seq.
    - sum of n numbers, first is a + last is b => n(a+b)/2

3. Geometric Seq.
    - sum of numbers from a to b => (bk-a)/(k-1) where k is common ratio

4. Harmonic Sum : sum from x = 1...n of 1/x
    -  1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6... <= 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4...
    - 1 + ... + 1/n <= log_{2}_(n) + 1

5. Set Theory
    - Set is a collection of elements
    - |A| is the size of A : number of elements
    - A n B is intersection : elements in both
    - A U B is union : elements in A or B or both
    - A^- is the complement : elements not in A
    - A n B^- the difference : elements in A and not in B

    - A is a subset of S if all elements in A are in S
    - set S has 2^|S| subsets
    
    - N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers)
    - {f(n):n E S} - applies function on each element of set

6. Logic
    - True(1) False(0)
    - -| or ! is negation (opposite value)
    - ^ conjunction (AND)
    - v disjunction (OR)
    - => implication (A => B is true if whenever A is true also B is true)
    - <=> equivalence (A <=> B is true if A and B are both true/false)
    - Predicate is an expression that evaluates true/false based on parameters -- Ex. P(x) - prime predicate
    - Quantifier connects a logical expression to the elements of a set 
        - (upside down A) for all (reverse E) there is
        - Ex. Ax(Ey(y<x)) means that for each element x in the set there is a y in the set such that 
    
    - Ax((x > 1 ^ !P(x))) => (Ea(Eb(a > 1 ^ b > 1 ^ x=ab))) means that for all x if x > 1 and not prime then there exists an a and b both greater than 1 such that x=a*b

7. Functions
    - FLOOR function rounds down
    - CEILING function rounds up
    - MIN returns the minimum of all x1, x2, ... xn
    - MAX returns the maximum of all x1, x2, ... xn
    - n! = 1 * 2 * ... * n
    - Fibonacci numbers
        - f(0) = 0
        - f(1) = 1
        - f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
        - f(n) = [(1 + sqrt(5))^n - (1 - sqrt(5))^n]/[(2^n)sqrt(5)]

    - LOGS
        - The number of digits of an integer x in base b is FLOOR(log_{2}_(x) + 1)
